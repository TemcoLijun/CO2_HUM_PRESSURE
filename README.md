# CO2_HUM_PRESSURE
This project is for a transducer module which can accomodate humidity, pressure and c02 sensors. The Code is done in C language on the STMXXX CPU and supports many ways of connecting to various controllers using both transducer signals and or networked communications. The protocols supported are bacnet and modbus protocols over both RS485 and Ethernet media. Transducer output signal mode is also supported using 10V, 5V and 4-20ma signals.
