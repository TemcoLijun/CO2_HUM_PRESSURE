# CO2_HUM_PRESSURE
This project is for a sesnor module which can accomodate humidity, pressure and c02 sensors. The Code is done in C language on the STM32F10x CPU and supports many methods of connecting to controllers using both transducer signals and or networked communications. The protocols supported are bacnet and modbus protocols over both RS485 and Ethernet media. Transducer output signal mode is also supported using 10V, 5V and 4-20ma signals. 


This product is targeted at OEM's and can be customized for your application for a very modest setup fee, or none at all if you're purchasing in a 'decent' volume. Pricing starts at $45 USD, Qty1. Here's a link to the product page:
